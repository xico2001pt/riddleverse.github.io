title: "Day 9: Unlocking Mobility"
previously: >
    After following a mysterious radio signal to the Ferris wheel, you encountered <b>Jolly</b>, a worn-out robot from the old carnival. Though cautious, Jolly revealed that it has a plan to retrieve the <b>Crystal of Joy</b>, but its systems are too damaged to help. After passing a test of trust by retrieving a <b>Power Core</b> from the central generator, Jolly is partially restored. Now, it needs a <b>servo motor</b> to regain mobility, which is hidden in the twisted remains of the carnival's <b>carousel</b>.
narrative: >
    With the Power Core now securely in place, the faint hum of Jolly’s systems fills the air, but the robot remains stationary, its joints stiff from years of disuse. While Jolly’s eyes glow brighter, it’s clear that full mobility is still beyond reach.
    <br><br>
    <i>“Thanks for getting me powered up, but I’m still stuck here,”</i> Jolly says, glancing at its motionless legs. <i>“To get moving again, I’ll need a <b>servo motor</b>. Luckily, I know where we can find one—the old carousel over by the heart of the carnival.”<i>
    <br><br>
    You remember passing the dilapidated ride earlier. Once a centerpiece of joy, the carousel now stands twisted and broken, its horses frozen in place.
    <br><br>
    <i>“The motor I need is inside the control room,”</i> Jolly explains. <i>“But it’s locked behind a security system — a four-digit <b>PIN locker</b>. I can’t crack it, but the good news is that there’s a clue nearby — an old piece of paper with failed attempts. Whoever tried before left notes, and the lock is special — it tells you if a digit is in the right place or just part of the code but in the wrong spot.”</i>
    <br><br>
    Jolly’s voice lowers. <i>“The corruption in this place is getting stronger. We don’t have time to waste. If you can crack that code, I’ll be back on my feet, and we’ll finally be ready to move forward with the plan.”</i>
    <br><br>
    With Jolly's instructions clear, you make your way toward the carousel. The path is littered with debris, remnants of the once-lively carnival that now feels like a forgotten wasteland. As you approach the carousel, the air feels thick, as if the very energy of the place has been drained. You see the control room, tucked away beneath the ride, its entrance guarded by the PIN locker Jolly mentioned.
    <br><br>
    Now it’s up to you to unlock it and retrieve the servo motor.
objective: >
    Your goal is to unlock the PIN locker securing the servo motor hidden in the carousel's control room. Using the paper with previous failed attempts and the locker’s hints, decipher the correct four-digit code.
outcome: >
    After carefully analyzing the previous attempts and clues from the locker, you input the final code. The screen flashes green, and with a mechanical click, the locker unlocks. The compartment slowly opens, revealing the servo motor you've been searching for. It's covered in dust and grime, but it appears intact, ready to restore Jolly’s mobility.
    <br><br>
    Jolly’s voice crackles through the radio, excited and relieved: <i>“You did it! I’ll be back on my feet in no time. Bring that servo motor here, and I’ll finally be able to move. Then we can really kick this plan into gear.”</i>
    <br><br>
    As you retrieve the servo motor and make your way back to Jolly, the eerie silence of the carnival presses in. The corruption lingers, but with Jolly nearly restored, there's a glimmer of hope that the plan to retrieve the <b>Crystal of Joy</b> is within reach. Now, with Jolly's full cooperation, the next step in the journey can begin.

Find the four-number code that opens the locker using the clues that are written in the paper placed nearby.

The paper has the following written:

```
- Only use digits from 0 to 5.
- Each digit can only be used once.

Attempt 1:
Code: 4150
Different Position: 2
Correct Position: 2

Attempt 2:
Code: 3054
Different Position: 1
Correct Position: 2

Attempt 3:
Code: 0123
Different Position: 0
Correct Position: 2

Attempt 4:
Code: 3514
Different Position: 2
Correct Position: 1
```

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by working out which digits belong in the code, regardless of order.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Every digit in the code is in the very top row of digits. Two of the digits in 4150 are even in the right place. 
</details>

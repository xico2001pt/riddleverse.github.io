title: "Day 3: Perilous Froststeps"
previously: >
    After unlocking the gates of the Frosty Forest and navigating the shifting corridors of the Rotating Labyrinth, you emerged onto a ledge overlooking the icy wilderness. The Ember of Warmth is still beyond reach, but the path forward leads you higher up the Frostspire, where the last challenge awaits.
narrative: >
    Leaving the maze behind, you step onto the frosty path that spirals up the side of the Frostspire. The ascent is steep and cold, but you press on, knowing the Ember of Warmth awaits. As you climb higher, the wind howls louder, and the thin air bites at your skin.
    <br><br>
    Soon, you reach a staircase carved into the mountain, glowing faintly with ancient magic. This is the <b>Guardian’s Trial</b>, the final test before the Ember can be reached. The Guardian of the Hearth has been imprisoned by the malevolent force, bound by powerful magic. The Guardian’s voice echoes faintly, trapped and unable to help directly. However, the trial itself remains active, enforcing the ancient laws of the keep.
    <br><br>
    The voice speaks softly but urgently: <i>I cannot aid you directly, for I am bound by the very magic that protects the Ember. The path forward requires wisdom — step only on those numbers that follow the rhythm of the prime. Tread carefully, for one wrong step will cast you into the abyss.</i>
    <br><br>
    The trial isn't the Guardian's will but an ancient safeguard. You must prove your worth by solving the riddle of the stairs to ascend.
objective: >
    Your objective is to identify and step only on the safe spots. Enter the correct sequence to safely ascend the 30 steps and continue your journey to the Ember of Warmth.
outcome: >
    After successfully identifying the correct sequence, you ascend safely to the next level of the Frostspire. The wind seems to calm as you climb higher, and the Guardian's presence fades. The path ahead leads right to the Ember of Warmth.
    <br><br>
    Just as the Ember of Warmth comes into view, a shadowy presence creeps over the icy path. The air grows colder and darker, and a sinister force begins to manifest between you and the Ember. Your heart races — this was supposed to be the final stretch, but something dangerous is blocking your way.

As you stand before the magical staircase, the steps shimmer with ancient numbers. Some glow brightly, while others appear cracked and unstable, as if someone has tried and failed to ascend before. You notice that the steps marked **2**, **3**, **5**, **7**, and **11** appear safe, while others (up to the step number 11) show signs of wear and danger.

The Guardian's cryptic words echo in your mind:

> Step only on those numbers that follow the rhythm of the prime.

Given the fact that the staircase has 30 steps and the steps are inscribed with numbers ranging from 1 to 30, your task is to determine the correct sequence of safe steps based on this pattern.

Notice that:
- The sequence values should be separated by commas (`,`).
- The sequence should start with `2,3,5,7,11` and must be ordered from the smallest to the largest value.

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary> 
 You notice that numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 seem untouched and stable. There might be something special about these numbers.

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary> 
 Look for numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. These numbers seem to hold the key to safe passage.

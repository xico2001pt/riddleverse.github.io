<br>

You wake with a start, disoriented and aching from the explosion. As your vision clears, you realize you are no longer in the crumbling palace but in a strange, ethereal world. The air here feels different — heavy with mystery and magic. Beside you stands a ghostly figure, the **Guardian of the Veil of Wonder**, her form shimmering like stardust in the soft light.

<br>

*“I used the last of my strength to bring you here,”* she says, her voice gentle but fading. *“Right after the explosion, I teleported you to the **Forgotten Dreamscape**. This is where the **Veil of Wonder** is hidden — the last hope for restoring Christmas. But I am weak now. The explosion drained what little energy I had left. You’ll have to continue without me.”*

<br>

You try to ask more, but the Guardian raises her hand, pointing toward the horizon. *“This realm is made up of **six islands**, each tied to fading fragments of wonder and imagination. I’ve hidden myself on the farthest island to protect myself. To reach the main island, where the Veil is kept, you’ll need to travel through all six islands.”*

<br>

The Guardian’s figure begins to fade, her voice softening. *“Hurry... before the Dreamscape fades completely.”*

<br>

The journey ahead seems daunting, but the path is clear — six islands, each holding a key to reclaiming the **Veil of Wonder** and restoring the last flickers of Christmas magic. There is no turning back now.

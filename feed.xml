Your task is to correctly place the lenses and absorb the right lasers to prevent them from reflecting and triggering the alarm.</p>

<p>The lasers in the room are of the following colors: <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Green</strong>, <strong>Blue</strong>, <strong>Cyan</strong>, <strong>Magenta</strong>, <strong>Yellow</strong>, and <strong>White</strong>.</p>

<p>Notice that:</p>

  <li>The <strong>Magenta (M) lens</strong> absorbs <strong>Green light</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Yellow (Y) lens</strong> absorbs <strong>Blue light</strong>.</li>
  <li>The answer should be a sequence ordered according to the lasers listed above containing the lens that should be used to absorb the respective light separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>).

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by matching the <b>primary color lasers</b> (Red, Green, and Blue) to their corresponding lenses.

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow colors are a mix the other RGB colors. But which ones? After figuring out, apply the same logic by combining more than one lens.

Once the correct sequence is established, the mechanism will light up a <strong>lamp</strong>, signaling that the compartment has been unlocked.</p>

<p>The circuit board in front of you displays a series of interconnected <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>XOR</strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong> gates, each affecting the flow of electricity. Your goal is to guide the power from the input through the logic gates in such a way that it activates the output lamp.</p>

<div><img class="challenge-img" src="/assets/img/stories/christmas2024/logic-circuit.png" /></div>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must manipulate the switches connected to the input so that the output result activates the lamp.</li>
  <li><strong>AND Gates</strong> require both inputs to be active for the power to pass through.</li>
  <li><strong>OR Gates</strong> allow power to pass if at least one input is active.</li>
  <li><strong>XOR Gates</strong> allow power to pass only if one input is active, but not both. If both inputs are active, the power is blocked.</li>
  <li><strong>NOT Gates</strong> invert the signal, meaning an inactive input becomes active and vice versa.</li>
  <li>The answer must contain the activation state of the switches from the top to the bottom, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> indicates <strong>active</strong> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> indicates <strong>inactive</strong>. An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00011</code>.</li>
  <li>Note that there is more than one possible answer.</li>
</ul>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by focusing on the <b>end of the circuit</b> where the lamp is. Work backwards from there to figure out how the power needs to flow to reach the output.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 The last two switches in the sequence are very direct and will help you narrow down the correct path. Pay close attention to those.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 3</summary>
 Be careful with the <b>XOR gates</b> — they require exactly one input to be active, so ensure you're sending only one signal through.

<p>As you step through the portal, the icy winds of the Frostspire are left behind, replaced by something far more unsettling. The air is thick, heavy with a sense of unease, and the sky above is a patchwork of dark clouds and garish lights. Before you stretches the once-vibrant <strong>Realm of Joy</strong>, now twisted into a grotesque reflection of its former self. Where there was once laughter and music, now eerie echoes and distorted melodies hang in the air. The festival grounds, a place that once symbolized happiness and lightheartedness, have become a dark carnival, its joy drained by the malevolent force.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The <strong>Crystal of Joy</strong>, once glowing with radiant colors, has darkened and now casts a dim, sickly light over the land. It is hidden deep within the heart of the festival, locked away in the <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>, where the <strong>Guardian of Laughter</strong> — the one sworn to protect it — has been corrupted. The Guardian’s once carefree and playful nature has been twisted into mockery, their laughter now cruel and haunting.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As you survey the warped carnival before you, you feel the weight of the task ahead. The vibrant tents and rides are now eerie silhouettes, looming in the distance. The flickering lights, once warm and inviting, now pulse with unnatural energy. The path is obscured by <strong>illusions</strong> and riddled with <strong>emotional traps</strong> meant to confuse and demoralize you.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But you cannot falter. To restore the Crystal of Joy, you will need to make your way through the heart of the festival, break through the illusions, and face the twisted Guardian. Only then can you hope to return joy and laughter to the Christmas Realm.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>With determination, you take your first step into the twisted carnival. The journey to restore joy has begun…</p>]]></content><author><name>Francisco Cerqueira</name></author><category term="christmas2024" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 6: Shattering the Veil</title><link href="https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act1/shattering-the-veil/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 6: Shattering the Veil" /><published>2024-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act1/shattering-the-veil</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act1/shattering-the-veil/"><![CDATA[<p>A malevolent force has enveloped the mystical Ember with four elemental barriers.

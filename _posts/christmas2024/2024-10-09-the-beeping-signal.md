title: "Day 7: The Beeping Signal"
previously: >
    After restoring the Ember of Warmth in the Frostspire, your journey led you to the once-vibrant Realm of Joy, now corrupted into a twisted carnival. The <b>Crystal of Joy</b>, the artifact responsible for spreading happiness, has darkened under the malevolent force’s influence. To restore the magic, you must navigate through this eerie and distorted festival, where illusions and emotional traps seek to break your spirit.
narrative: >
    As you step deeper into the carnival grounds, you feel a strange silence around you, broken only by the distant sound of warped carnival music. The once-vibrant colors are now dim and distorted, with shadows twisting in unnatural ways.
    <br><br>
    Suddenly, through the faint mist ahead, you hear a faint <b>beeping sound</b> — an electronic rhythm cutting through the oppressive atmosphere. You cautiously follow the sound until you find a small, weathered radio, half-buried under discarded festival decorations. The radio's rhythmic beeping repeats over and over, and you realize it isn’t random noise. The pattern seems familiar — it’s <b>Morse code</b>.
    <br><br>
    Instinctively, you begin listening more closely. As the beeping continues, you feel a sense of urgency. Decoding this message might be your first real clue in this twisted place, but the meaning behind it is still unclear.
objective: >
    Your task is to decode the Morse code signal coming from the radio.
outcome: >
    As you finish decoding the rhythmic beeping, the message becomes clear: <b>WHEEL</b>. A sudden realization hits you — the signal is guiding you toward the old <b>Ferris wheel</b>, a towering silhouette you noticed when you first entered the carnival grounds. Though its colorful lights flicker weakly, it still looms over the dark festival, casting long shadows across the grounds.
    <br><br>
    With the location clear, you make your way through the pathways toward there. But something — or someone — seems to be waiting for you there. A figure hidden in the shadows catches your eye. You can't shake the feeling that this meeting is far from coincidence. The wheel creaks louder as if urging you forward.
    <br><br>
    Who — or what — awaits you at the wheel? There is only one way to find out.

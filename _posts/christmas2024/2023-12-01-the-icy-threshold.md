    After receiving a desperate plea from the Christmas Realm, you set out on a quest to restore the fading Christmas Spirit. The first step in your journey leads you to the edge of the Frosty Forest, a once-beautiful place now engulfed in a bone-chilling cold. Ahead lies the Guardian's keep, where the Ember of Warmth is hidden deep within the Vault of the Hearth. But before you can enter, you must solve the riddle that seals the gates.
narrative: >
    As you step into the Frosty Forest, the temperature drops dramatically. The trees, once green and full of life, are now coated in thick layers of frost. A dense fog rolls in, obscuring your path, and the only sound is the crunch of snow beneath your feet. You approach the towering gates of the Guardian’s keep. Carved into the gate is an ancient riddle, the key to unlocking the entrance and beginning your quest.
objective: >
    Your objective is to decipher the riddle inscribed on the gates. Solving it will open the way forward, allowing you to enter the keep and continue your journey to reclaim the Ember of Warmth.
outcome: >
    As you enter the correct answer, the icy gates begin to tremble and groan, slowly revealing the path beyond. The fog begins to clear, and you step forward, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

    As the path opens before you, you spot the twisting corridors of the Frozen Labyrinth. When you get there, you will have to navigate this ever-changing maze to draw closer to the Ember of Warmth and its imprisoned Guardian.

The riddle etched into the gates reads:

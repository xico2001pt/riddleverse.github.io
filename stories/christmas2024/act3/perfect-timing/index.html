    <h2>Previously</h2>
    After the explosion, you were transported to the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b> by the <b>Guardian of the Veil of Wonder</b>. Anticipating the arrival of the evil force, the Guardian split the <b>Veil of Wonder</b> into six fragments and scattered them across the six islands of the Dreamscape. Now, your mission is to collect each fragment and restore the Veil on the <b>main island</b>. With the Guardian too weak to continue, the journey to save Christmas rests entirely in your hands.

    <h2>Narrative</h3>
    As you stand at the edge of the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b>, the Guardian of the Veil of Wonder reappears, her form flickering. Her voice is soft but urgent. <br><br> <i>"Time doesn’t flow the same way on each island. It bends and shifts — some islands will slow you down, others will speed time up. To retrieve the fragments of the Veil, you'll need to carefully calculate your journey."</i> She gestures to the islands, each pulsing with its own strange rhythm. <i>"Misjudge the timing, and you may arrive too late."</i> <br><br> You study the islands — some shimmer with vibrant energy, others seem slow and distant. The path to the main island is far from simple. <br><br> <i>"While you make your way through the islands, I will rest,"</i> the Guardian continues. <i>"If your timing is correct, I will meet you at the main island to help restore the Veil. But remember, if you miscalculate, you could lose precious time."</i> <br><br> She waits, her eyes on you, as the weight of the task settles in. You must calculate the timings perfectly.

    <h2>Objective</h3>
    Carefully calculate the time it will take to travel through all six islands and meet the Guardian at the main island to restore the Veil of Wonder.

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Forgotten Dreamscape</strong> is made up of six islands surrounding the <strong>main island at the center</strong>. To collect the fragments of the Veil of Wonder, you must travel from your <strong>starting island</strong>, pass through the main island, and continue to the six surrounding islands. Time flows differently on each island, and the cloud bridges between islands take no time to travel.</p>

<div><img class="challenge-img" src="/assets/img/stories/christmas2024/forgotten-dreamscape-islands.webp" /></div>

<p>Below are the <strong>estimated times</strong> you will spend on <strong>each island</strong>, along with the <strong>time dilation factor</strong> for each island. Your task is to calculate <strong>how long</strong> it will take to <strong>complete the journey</strong> and meet the Guardian at the main island.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Island</th>
            <th>Estimated Local Duration</th>
            <th>Time Dilation Factor</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>30 minutes</td>
            <td>x2 (time moves twice as fast)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>50 minutes</td>
            <td>x0.5 (time moves half as fast)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>5 minutes</td>
            <td>x1 (normal time)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>25 minutes</td>
            <td>x3 (time moves three times as fast)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>40 minutes</td>
            <td>x0.25 (time moves very slowly)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>12 minutes</td>
            <td>x1.5 (time moves faster than normal)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Main Island</td>
            <td>
                10 minutes to reactivate bridges, <br />
                10 minutes for <b>each</b> displacement between bridges
            </td>
            <td>x1 (normal time)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You start at <strong>Island 3</strong>.</li>
  <li>When reaching the <strong>main island</strong> to travel to another island, you must account <strong>10 minutes</strong> for <strong>each</strong> displacement between bridges.</li>
  <li>The answer is the total number of <strong>minutes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 For each island, you need to multiply the time dilation factor for the time spent there.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Each time you go to the main island to get to another island, you need to sum 10 minutes to account for internal displacement.
</details>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        After presenting your calculations, the Guardian smiles faintly. <i>"Your plan is sound,"</i> she says, <i>"but there's something you didn’t realize. The fragment from this island is <b>already with you</b> — I gave it to you when I brought you here."</i> <br><br> A soft glow within you confirms it. You’ve already taken the first step. <br><br> <i>"Now, go to the <b>Main Island</b> to <b>restore the missing bridges</b>. Only then can you reach the other islands and gather the remaining fragments. Time is short."</i> <br><br> With the first fragment in hand, you prepare to journey to the Main Island and continue your quest.

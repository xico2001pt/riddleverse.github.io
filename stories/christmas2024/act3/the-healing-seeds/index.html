    <h2>Previously</h2>
    After escaping the collapsing island by teleporting to the <b>Crystal Palace</b>, you found yourself reunited with both the Guardian and Jolly, relieved to see him safe. With the Guardian’s energy nearly depleted and Jolly by your side, you feel a renewed sense of purpose as you prepare to continue your journey. Only one final step remains to fully restore the Veil of Wonder and confront the looming darkness.

    <h2>Narrative</h3>
    As you arrive at the <b>Crystal Palace</b>, relief washes over you, seeing both the Guardian and Jolly waiting. After the chaos of the crumbling islands, it’s a comfort to be reunited, especially with Jolly safe and sound. You can’t help but ask him, <i>"How did you make it?"</i> <br><br> Jolly’s eyes gleam with excitement as it explains, <i>"Once you freed the Guardian, it had just enough power left to rebuild me. I'm as good as new, ready to help you see this through!"</i> <br><br> Together, the three of you discuss the path ahead. Jolly shares the plan they have devised: <i>"To finally overcome the Evil Force and restore the Veil of Wonder, we must reunite all the Guardians and artifacts. The next step? Return to the <b>Vault of the Ember</b>, where it all began."</i> With purpose renewed, you travel together back to the vault. <br><br> Arriving at the Vault of the Ember, you’re greeted by the Guardian of the Hearth, standing near the flickering Ember of Warmth. After exchanging words of gratitude, Jolly turns his focus to the Ember Guardian. <i>"There’s something critical left to do here,"</i> he says, nodding toward a rare, glowing plant near the Ember. "This plant has powerful healing properties, and its seeds could be exactly what the Guardian of the Veil will need to restore her strength when we reach her."</i> <br><br> Jolly continues, <i>"The seeds are potent, but we’ll need as many as possible within the time we have."</i> You look to the plant, realizing this will be a delicate calculation — a test of timing to ensure you gather enough seeds before the next phase of your journey.

    <h2>Objective</h3>
    Determine the maximum number of healing seeds you can gather within the given time window to restore the Guardian's strength.

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>You begin with <strong>two</strong> healing seeds. After planting them, the Guardian of the Hearth can use its powers to accelerate their growth cycle, allowing each plant to mature and produce <strong>two seeds after 5 minutes</strong> before <strong>dying</strong>. Each new seed can then be replanted, continuing the cycle.</p>

<p>Starting with <strong>two seeds</strong> and with exactly <strong>1 hour</strong> available, calculate how many seeds you’ll have by the end of the time limit, maximizing the harvest to support the Guardian of the Veil in the final confrontation.</p>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Each plant only lives for one cycle, so consider how many cycles you can achieve within the hour to maximize seed production.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Think of each new seed as a multiplying factor, starting with two and doubling with each cycle.
</details>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        With the seeds carefully harvested, you gather them into a small pouch, feeling the warmth and energy they radiate. The Guardian of the Hearth summons its remaining strength, and in a flash of light, you find yourself standing on the familiar shores of the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b>. <br><br> There, waiting in the quiet glow of the island, is the weakened Guardian of the Veil of Wonder. Gently, you hand her the seeds, watching as they shimmer in her hands. She closes her eyes, drawing on the healing energy, and her form grows brighter, stronger. <br><br> A quiet gratitude fills the air as the Guardian opens her eyes, restored and ready. Together, you share a silent moment, knowing that with this final strength, the ultimate step in your journey awaits — the final act to restore the last of the Christmas magic.

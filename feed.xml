However, your ability to channel these powers is limited by a <strong>maximum energy capacity of 20 units</strong>. Each power carries a unique energy consumption and contributes a different level of magical power. Your challenge is to <strong>maximize the total power</strong> used within this energy constraint to ensure victory.</p>

<p>The available powers, their energy weights, and their strengths are as follows:
|Id|Name|Energy Consumption|Magical Power|
|—|—|—|—|
|1|Radiant Blaze|2|12|
|2|Gale’s Whisper|3|10|
|3|Titan’s Embrace|5|20|
|4|Lunar Shield|6|15|
|5|Starlight Surge|7|25|
|6|Ember’s Touch|4|8|
|7|Crystal Bloom|3|9|
|8|Ethereal Echo|8|30|
|9|Void’s Wrath|9|50|</p>

<p>Notice that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your goal is to <strong>maximize the total magical power</strong> without exceeding the <strong>energy capacity of 20 units</strong>.</li>
  <li>The answer must contain the <strong>ids of the used powers</strong>, in any order, separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>). An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8,1,5,7</code>.</li>
</ul>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Focus on selecting the combination of powers that provides the highest total magical force while staying within the 20-unit energy limit. Sometimes, choosing fewer powerful abilities can be more effective than many weaker ones.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 This problem is know as the knapsack problem. There are solvers online.

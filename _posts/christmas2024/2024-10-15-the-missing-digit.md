title: "Day 13: The Missing Digit"
previously: >
    After navigating the dark cave, guided by Jolly’s voice, you thought you had successfully made your way through the underground maze. However, just as you reached what seemed like the exit, a sudden shift in the atmosphere revealed the truth: the voice guiding you wasn’t Jolly at all. In the darkness, you had been tricked by a sinister illusion, and the real Jolly had been captured when the lights went out. Now, you find yourself trapped, with the real Jolly locked up somewhere nearby, and your mission to reach the Crystal of Joy hangs in the balance.
narrative: >
    The cold, metallic walls of the cell press in on you as the truth sinks in. You were fooled, led into this trap by the malevolent force. The real Jolly, the one you’ve been relying on, is nearby but trapped as well. You can hear Jolly’s voice faintly from the cell next to yours, its usual calm demeanor now tinged with urgency.
    <br><br>
    <i>"I’m in here... they got me when the lights went out,"</i> Jolly says. <i>"But I think I’ve found a way to hack into the security system. There’s a digital lock on my cell, and I managed to pull up the code... mostly. There’s a problem with the last digit, it’s flickering, malfunctioning. I can’t get a clear read. The first four digits are fine, but without the last one, the code won’t work. You’ll have to figure it out."</i>
    <br><br>
    The pressure is on. Your exit depends on solving this final puzzle and freeing Jolly. With the final piece in place, you’ll both be able to continue your quest to recover the <b>Crystal of Joy</b> — but only if you can think quickly and trust your instincts.
objective: >
    Deduce the missing last digit of Jolly's lock code.
outcome: >
    As you carefully deduce the missing character from Jolly’s malfunctioning display, the final piece of the puzzle clicks into place. You input the full code into your lock, and with a soft beep, the door to Jolly’s cell slides open. A brief moment of relief washes over you as Jolly steps out, its mechanical eyes flickering in acknowledgment of your success.
    <br><br>
    <i>“We did it,”</i> Jolly says, the tension in its voice fading. <i>“But this isn’t over yet. The Crystal of Joy is still deep within the palace. We need to move quickly—whatever tricked us before is still out there, watching.”</i>
    <br><br>
    The cellblock now feels like the calm before the storm. With Jolly by your side once more, you both know the final challenge awaits. The Crystal of Joy lies ahead, heavily guarded by the malevolent force that has cast a dark shadow over the carnival and the Christmas Realm.
    <br><br>
    Together, you make your way out of the prison and towards the heart of the palace, where the final showdown awaits.

A bunch of figures are arranged in a pattern as shown in the code below:

<div><img class="challenge-img" src="/assets/img/stories/christmas2024/locker-code-incomplete.png"></div>

Can you figure out which symbol is missing **at the end**?

<div><img class="challenge-img" src="/assets/img/stories/christmas2024/symbol-example.png"></div>

Notice that:
- You must determine which dashes must be **active** to depict the intended **symbol**, following the **numeration** of the figure above.
- Your answer must contain the **index** of the dashes **ordered** from the smallest to the largest one. For example, the answer `136` activates the dashes that represent the number seven.

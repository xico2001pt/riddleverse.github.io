<p>You wake with a start, disoriented and aching from the explosion. As your vision clears, you realize you are no longer in the crumbling palace but in a strange, ethereal world. The air here feels different — heavy with mystery and magic. Beside you stands a ghostly figure, the <strong>Guardian of the Veil of Wonder</strong>, her form shimmering like stardust in the soft light.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>“I used the last of my strength to bring you here,”</em> she says, her voice gentle but fading. <em>“Before the explosion, I anticipated the coming of the evil force. To protect the Veil, I split it into six fragments and scattered them across the islands of the <strong>Forgotten Dreamscape</strong>. This is where the last hope for restoring Christmas lies.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The Guardian gestures toward the horizon, where the islands float in the mist. <em>“The <strong>main island</strong>, where the Veil must be restored, is at the center of this realm. However, two of the islands have been severed from it, cut off by the malevolent force. To reassemble the Veil of Wonder, you must <strong>visit all six islands</strong>, reclaim the fragments, and return them to the main island to reignite its power.”</em>
<br /></p>

<p>Her voice softens, growing faint as her form flickers. <em>“I am too weak now to guide you further. You must continue alone. But be careful — this realm is fragile, and the evil force grows stronger with each passing moment.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The journey ahead is daunting, but the path is clear. Six islands, each holding a piece of the <strong>Veil of Wonder</strong>, must be traversed to restore Christmas magic…</p>]]></content><author><name>Francisco Cerqueira</name></author><category term="christmas2024" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 14: Final Pulse</title><link href="https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act2/final-pulse/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 14: Final Pulse" /><published>2024-10-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act2/final-pulse</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act2/final-pulse/"><![CDATA[<p>Jolly has the capability to use <strong>electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)</strong> to shatter the <strong>four barriers</strong> surrounding the <strong>Crystal of Joy</strong>. However, each barrier requires a specific amount of power to be disrupted, and Jolly’s battery has a limited capacity.</p>

<p>The <strong>power</strong> needed for each barrier follows <strong>specific rules</strong> based on the strength of the emotional energy each barrier draws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>sum of the power</strong> required for <strong>all four barriers</strong> equals <strong>100 units</strong> (Jolly’s full battery capacity).</li>
  <li>The barrier of <strong>Doubt</strong> requires <strong>more 5 units</strong> of power than <strong>Fear</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Despair</strong> demands <strong>twice the amount</strong> of power as <strong>Sorrow</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong> and <strong>Sorrow together</strong> use exactly <strong>45 units</strong> of power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your answer must be contain the amount of power dedicated to each barrier — <strong>Fear</strong>, <strong>Doubt</strong>, <strong>Sorrow</strong>, and <strong>Despair</strong>, respectively — separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>). An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">25,20,30,25</code>.</p>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by replacing the barriers' names by letters and formalizing the problem as a system of equations.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Try to replace the variables of the equation so that you end up with only one variable remaining.

Once the correct sequence is established, the mechanism will light up a <strong>lamp</strong>, signaling that the compartment has been unlocked.</p>

<p>The circuit board in front of you displays a series of interconnected <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>XOR</strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong> gates, each affecting the flow of electricity. Your goal is to guide the power from the input through the logic gates in such a way that it activates the output lamp.</p>

<div><img class="challenge-img" src="/assets/img/stories/christmas2024/logic-circuit.png" /></div>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must manipulate the switches connected to the input so that the output result activates the lamp.</li>
  <li><strong>AND Gates</strong> require both inputs to be active for the power to pass through.</li>
  <li><strong>OR Gates</strong> allow power to pass if at least one input is active.</li>
  <li><strong>XOR Gates</strong> allow power to pass only if one input is active, but not both. If both inputs are active, the power is blocked.</li>
  <li><strong>NOT Gates</strong> invert the signal, meaning an inactive input becomes active and vice versa.</li>
  <li>The answer must contain the activation state of the switches from the top to the bottom, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> indicates <strong>active</strong> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> indicates <strong>inactive</strong>. An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00011</code>.</li>
  <li>Note that there is more than one possible answer.</li>
</ul>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by focusing on the <b>end of the circuit</b> where the lamp is. Work backwards from there to figure out how the power needs to flow to reach the output.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 The last two switches in the sequence are very direct and will help you narrow down the correct path. Pay close attention to those.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 3</summary>
 Be careful with the <b>XOR gates</b> — they require exactly one input to be active, so ensure you're sending only one signal through.

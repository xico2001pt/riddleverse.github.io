 Think about the way the wheel works. If two measures are added at the bottom compartment, how much time will pass before they return?

<p>You wake up from the explosion. As your vision clears, you realize you are no longer in the crumbling palace but in a strange, ethereal world. The air here feels different — heavy with mystery and magic. Beside you stands a ghostly figure, the <strong>Guardian of the Veil of Wonder</strong>, her form shimmering like stardust in the soft light.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>“I used the last of my strength to bring you here,”</em> she says, her voice gentle but fading. <em>“Before the explosion, I anticipated the coming of the evil force. To protect the Veil, I split it into six fragments and scattered them across the islands of the <strong>Forgotten Dreamscape</strong>. This is where the last hope for restoring Christmas lies.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The Guardian gestures toward the horizon, where the islands float in the mist. <em>“The <strong>main island</strong>, where the Veil must be restored, is at the center of this realm. However, two of the islands have been severed from it, cut off by the malevolent force. To reassemble the Veil of Wonder, you must <strong>visit all six islands</strong>, reclaim the fragments, and return them to the main island to reignite its power.”</em>
<br /></p>

<p>Her voice softens, growing faint as her form flickers. <em>“I am too weak now to guide you further. You must continue alone. But be careful — this realm is fragile, and the evil force grows stronger with each passing moment.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The journey ahead is daunting, but the path is clear.

However, each barrier requires a specific amount of power to be disrupted, and Jolly’s battery has a limited capacity.</p>

<p>The <strong>power</strong> needed for each barrier follows <strong>specific rules</strong> based on the strength of the emotional energy each barrier draws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>sum of the power</strong> required for <strong>all four barriers</strong> equals <strong>100 units</strong> (Jolly’s full battery capacity).</li>
  <li>The barrier of <strong>Doubt</strong> requires <strong>more 5 units</strong> of power than <strong>Fear</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Despair</strong> demands <strong>twice the amount</strong> of power as <strong>Sorrow</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong> and <strong>Sorrow together</strong> use exactly <strong>45 units</strong> of power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your answer must be contain the amount of power dedicated to each barrier — <strong>Fear</strong>, <strong>Doubt</strong>, <strong>Sorrow</strong>, and <strong>Despair</strong>, respectively — separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>).

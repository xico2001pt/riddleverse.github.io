title: "Day 17: Lost Memories"
previously: >
    After arriving at the <b>Main Island</b>, you successfully restored the ancient bridges connecting the islands by solving the puzzle of the spinning wheels. With the bridges reactivated and the first fragment of the <b>Veil of Wonder</b> already in hand, you now turn your focus to the next island in the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b>, where another fragment awaits.
narrative: >
    As you step onto the <b>Island of Lost Memories</b>, a dense mist envelops you, muffling sounds and softening everything around you. The landscape is blurred and dreamlike, shifting with each step you take, as if reality here struggles to hold its form. Fragments of memories—half-formed shapes, faint voices, and flashes of long-forgotten places — drift through the fog, blending together into a tapestry of fleeting moments.
    <br><br>
    A familiar, faint voice reaches you, the <b>Guardian of the Veil of Wonder</b> speaking softly within your mind. <i>“I left a memory here, one that holds the key to the second fragment’s location. But the memory has fragmented, scattered across this island. You must find the pieces and reassemble them to reveal the fragment’s hiding place.”</i>
    <br><br>
    Looking around, you notice glimmers in the fog — slices of an image, each bearing part of a larger picture that seems achingly familiar yet incomplete. These memory fragments float and shift in the mist, half-hidden in the ethereal landscape. As you reach out to touch the first fragment, you sense the faint warmth of the Guardian’s energy, her lingering presence within these lost memories.
    <br><br>
    With the mist closing in around you, you realize you must act quickly. Piece by piece, you need to reassemble the image the Guardian left behind. Only by reconstructing this memory can you uncover the precise location of the second fragment of the <b>Veil of Wonder</b>.
    <br><br>
    The island tests not only your patience but also your ability to see through the fog of lost memories. You take a deep breath, focusing on the flickering images before you, and begin the task of bringing the Guardian’s memory back to life.
objective: >
    Reassemble the scattered image slices of the Guardian’s memory to reveal the location of the second fragment of the Veil of Wonder.
outcome: >
    With the memory reassembled, the image reveals a hidden pedestal surrounded by glowing symbols at the heart of the island. You hurry to the location, and as you approach, the fragment of the Veil of Wonder materializes, pulsing softly in response to your presence. The fragment’s faint glow resonates, filling you with a sense of purpose as you secure it.
    <br><br>
    The mist around you seems to lift slightly, as if acknowledging your success. With the second fragment in hand, you feel the island's weight lift and prepare to head to the next island, knowing that each step brings you closer to fulfilling your mission.

To reveal the location of the second fragment, you must reassemble the memory image left by the Guardian. The image has been divided into a **4x4 grid**, with each slice out of order.

Each slice corresponds to a numbered filename (e.g., 01.png, 02.png, etc.). Arrange the slices in the correct order to restore the complete image of the fragment’s location.

You can find the slices [here](/assets/file/stories/christmas2024/fragments.zip).

Notice that:
- The order of tiles corresponds to positions from the **top-left** corner to the **bottom-right** corner.
- Place them **from left to right** in each row, moving **top to bottom**.
- Your final answer should be the sequence of filenames from **1** to **16** in their correct positions.
- The answer should be an ordered sequence of the images' names separated by commas (`,`). Exclude any leading zeros from the answer.

For example, the answer `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16` will correspond to the tiles ordered in the following way:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
</table>

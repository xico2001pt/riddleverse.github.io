title: "Day 21: Symbols of the Lost"
previously: >
    On the <b>Spectrum Sanctuary</b>, you deciphered the hidden message within the refracted beams of light, revealing the location of the next fragment of the Veil of Wonder. Guided to a hidden clearing in the forebay, you claimed the fifth fragment and felt the island’s magic pulse with renewed life. Now, with only one fragment remaining, you set your sights on the next destination.
narrative: >
    Arriving at the <b>Island of Hidden Runes</b>, you’re immediately surrounded by towering stones etched with ancient markings, as if the land itself is whispering secrets long forgotten. The air is thick with an aura of timeless mystery, and the path leads you to a secluded stone wall in the heart of the island.
    <br><br>
    Upon the wall, three large symbols are painted, each distinct yet part of a hidden code. Studying them closely, you sense there’s a message to decode — a clue that will guide you to the final fragment of the <b>Veil of Wonder</b>.
objective: >
    Decode the hidden message in the symbols on the wall to uncover the location of the final fragment.
outcome: >
    As you piece together the letters and whisper the word <i>“RUN”</i>, a deep rumble echoes through the island, and the ground beneath you starts to shake violently. You rush outside to find the entire island trembling as if awakening from an ancient slumber. In the distance, the other islands begin to quake as well, each one crumbling and shifting as the cloud bridges that once connected them implode and vanish, one by one.
    <br><br>
    Amid the chaos, the <b>Guardian</b>’s voice reaches you, filled with alarm. <i>“The Evil Force… it must have sabotaged this place. The fragment you seek is not here.”</i> A dark presence seems to linger in the air, and you realize this has all been part of a trap. The only trace left behind is the taunting message: <i>“RUN”</i>.
    <br><br>
    With no path back, the final fragment still beyond reach, and the islands collapsing around you, the journey to restore the <b>Veil of Wonder</b> has taken a grim turn.

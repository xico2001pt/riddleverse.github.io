<br>

In a hidden realm parallel to our world, the Christmas Spirit is kept alive by three powerful artifacts: the Ember of Warmth, the Crystal of Joy, and the Veil of Wonder. Each artifact rests under the protection of legendary Guardians. Every century, these artifacts must be reawakened to renew the magic of Christmas. But this year, something has gone terribly wrong.

<br>

A malevolent force has swept through the Christmas Realm, imprisoning the Guardians and securing the artifacts. Without the artifacts, the magic of Christmas will fade, and with it, the warmth, joy, and wonder cherished by people across the world.

<br>

Your quest begins at the coldest point of this calamity—the Ember of Warmth. Once the heart of the Christmas Realm’s light and love, it now lies dormant, hidden deep within the Vault of the Hearth. The Guardian of the Hearth, bound in icy chains, can no longer protect it. The once vibrant lands are now veiled in a creeping chill, and the Ember’s glow has dimmed, casting shadows where warmth used to reign.

<br>

To restore balance and save Christmas, you must embark on a perilous journey into the frozen wilderness. The Ember of Warmth must be reignited, but the path is treacherous, filled with ancient puzzles and guarded secrets. The fate of the Christmas Realm, and the very spirit of Christmas, rests in your hands.

<br>

Good luck, adventurer!

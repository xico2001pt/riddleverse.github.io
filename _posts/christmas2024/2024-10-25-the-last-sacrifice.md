title: "Day 22: The Last Sacrifice"
previously: >
    Deciphering the symbols on the <b>Island of Hidden Runes</b>, you revealed the ominous message: <i>"RUN"</i>. Suddenly, the island began to collapse, along with the distant cloud bridges and other islands. The Guardian’s voice confirmed your fear — the Evil Force has taken the fragment and left behind a taunting message as the islands crumble.
narrative: >
    As the last of the island's structures collapse, you struggle to find footing on the crumbling ground. The Guardian’s voice reaches you, faint and strained, filled with sorrow and urgency.
    <br><br>
    <i>"I cannot hold the island much longer... but I can use the last of my strength to take you somewhere safe,"</i> she whispers. <i>"Tell me quickly — where should I teleport you?"</i>
    <br><br>
    Disoriented, your mind races, seeking a place of safety and hope. And then it hits you — the <b>Realm of Joy</b>. A place once brimming with light and laughter, a sanctuary you know has the power to guide you forward.
    <br><br>
    The Guardian's form shimmers, almost fading, as she gathers her remaining energy. <i>“Quickly,”</i> she pleads. <i>“Focus on the location in your heart, and I will get you there.”</i>
    <br><br>
    To complete this journey, you must pinpoint the exact place within the Realm of Joy where your next steps await.
objective: >
    Identify the precise location within the Realm of Joy where the Guardian can safely teleport you.
outcome: >
    As you call out <b>“Crystal Palace”</b>, the Guardian channels her remaining energy, and in a flash of light, you’re transported away from the crumbling island. The world spins, and when you open your eyes, you find yourself standing in the familiar gleam of the Crystal Palace, its grand halls glowing with joy and life once more.
    <br><br>
    To your surprise and relief, you see both the Guardian and Jolly waiting for you. Jolly’s eyes flash with excitement, his usual cheerful spirit intact. He waves with his mechanical arm, beaming, and you realize that, against all odds, he’s safe and sound. The Guardian gives you a faint, weary smile, nodding as if to say, <i>“You’re not alone.”</i>

The Guardian is ready to teleport you, but only if you can determine the exact location within the **Realm of Joy**. Reflecting on your journey, you recall key details about the realm that could guide you to safety.

When you believe you’ve identified the correct location, enter the answer to activate the teleportation spell and escape before the island collapses entirely.

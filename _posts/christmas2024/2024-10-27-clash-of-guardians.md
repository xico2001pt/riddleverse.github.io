title: "Day 24: Clash of Guardians"
previously: >
    After gathering the healing seeds in the Vault of the Ember, you journeyed to the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b> and restored the Guardian of the Veil of Wonder. With her strength renewed, you feel a powerful resolve settle over you — knowing that the final step to fully restore Christmas magic now awaits.
narrative: >
    With the guardians, Jolly, and the three precious artifacts in hand (although one of them not fully restored), you prepare for the <b>ultimate confrontation</b> on the main island of the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b>. The journey is tense, each moment echoing with the weight of the mission ahead. When you reach the island, the air feels heavy, charged with the sinister energy of the evil force now fully manifest. Shadows coil and twist like living tendrils, and atop a jagged peak, the <b>final fragment of the Veil of Wonder</b> is held captive within a vortex of dark magic.
    <br><br>
    The evil force lets out a menacing laugh, its voice reverberating across the sky. It challenges you and your companions, taunting the strength of the guardians and the light of your artifacts. Jolly steps forward, rallying everyone with a determined gaze. <i>"We have come this far together,"</i> Jolly says. <i>"Now, it’s time to end this darkness once and for all!"</i>
    <br><br>
    The guardians stand shoulder to shoulder, each one channeling the power of their artifacts. The Guardian of Warmth holds the blazing <b>Ember of Warmth</b>, casting waves of protective fire. The Guardian of Joy raises the <b>Crystal of Joy</b>, its light dispelling shadow. And the Guardian of Wonder focuses all remaining strength to support her allies with radiant threads of magic. Each artifact unleashes its latent power to generate a series of magical abilities. Fire, light, healing, barriers, illusions, and more, nine distinct powers emerge, each one vital to overcoming the dark force.
    <br><br>
    However, the power needed to break the barrier is immense, and <b>every use of magic comes at a cost</b>. Each power carries a specific weight in terms of energy consumption, and the total energy available is limited. You must carefully <b>select which powers to use</b> and how to combine them to maximize their impact against the swirling vortex, while ensuring the guardians retain enough energy to maintain the assault and defend themselves.
    <br><br>
    <i>"Choose wisely,"</i> warns the Guardian of Wonder, her gaze resolute but weary. <i>"The fate of our realm rests on finding the perfect balance."</i> With every moment, the vortex's grip tightens, and the evil force’s shadows loom closer. The challenge is clear: harness the nine powers generated by the artifacts, maximize their effectiveness, and defeat the dark force while staying within the constraints of the combined magical energy available. Only then can you reclaim the final fragment and restore the Veil of Wonder.
objective: >
    Strategically select which of the nine magical powers generated by the artifacts will maximize the impact within the available energy constraints, breaking the barrier protecting the final fragment, and defeating the evil force.
outcome: >
    With the <b>final battle</b> raging around you, the <b>guardians</b> channel their artifacts' magic with precision and determination, each one striking with the essence of warmth, joy, and wonder. The clash of power ignites bursts of blinding light and searing energy, pushing back the encroaching darkness. As you optimize the energy flow, channeling the combined strength of your allies, you feel the balance tip. Slowly but surely, the evil force's grip begins to <b>weaken</b>.
    <br><br>
    The ground <b>trembles</b> beneath you, and a swirling vortex of shadows erupts as the malevolent entity makes one last attempt to crush your resolve. But with one <b>final surge</b> of combined power, the guardians focus their energies, amplifying your resolve and guiding you to the <b>final fragment</b> of the Veil of Wonder. In a burst of radiant light, you grasp it, and its energy floods over everyone, banishing the shadows once and for all. The defeated evil force dissipates into the ether, unable to withstand the unity and purity of the magic wielded against it.
    <br><br>
    As the dust settles, the guardians stand beside you, weary but victorious. Jolly steps forward, eyes filled with pride and relief. The <b>Veil of Wonder</b> is restored, its fragments fused together in a brilliant display. Light once again fills the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b> and beyond, rekindling the festive magic that had been lost. The cloud bridges reconnect, the islands are restored, and joy spreads through every corner of the realms.
    <br><br>
    The guardians, Jolly, and you share a quiet moment of <b>triumph</b>. The guardians pledge to protect the magic and keep it safe for future generations. Jolly turns to you, beaming. <i>"We did it. Together."</i> And as you look out over the restored lands, the warmth of victory fills you. A new dawn has arrived, one illuminated by hope, unity, and the enduring spirit of joy.
    <br><br>
    <b>Congratulations</b>, you have completed your quest, saved the realms, and <b>restored the Christmas magic</b>.

As the battle against the evil force reaches its climax, you must harness the artifacts' nine magical powers to overcome the protective barrier around the final fragment. However, your ability to channel these powers is limited by a **maximum energy capacity of 20 units**. Each power carries a unique energy consumption and contributes a different level of magical power. Your challenge is to **maximize the total power** used within this energy constraint to ensure victory.

The available powers, their energy weights, and their strengths are as follows:
|Id|Name|Energy Consumption|Magical Power|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Radiant Blaze|2|12|
|2|Gale's Whisper|3|10|
|3|Titan's Embrace|5|20|
|4|Lunar Shield|6|15|
|5|Starlight Surge|7|25|
|6|Ember's Touch|4|8|
|7|Crystal Bloom|3|9|
|8|Ethereal Echo|8|30|
|9|Void's Wrath|9|50|

Notice that:
- Your goal is to **maximize the total magical power** without exceeding the **energy capacity of 20 units**.
- The answer must contain the **ids of the used powers**, in any order, separated by commas (`,`). An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be `8,1,5,7`.

 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Focus on selecting the combination of powers that provides the highest total magical force while staying within the 20-unit energy limit. Sometimes, choosing fewer powerful abilities can be more effective than many weaker ones.

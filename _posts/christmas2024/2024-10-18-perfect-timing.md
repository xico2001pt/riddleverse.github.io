title: "Day 15: Perfect Timing"
previously: >
    After the explosion, you were transported to the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b> by the <b>Guardian of the Veil of Wonder</b>. Anticipating the arrival of the evil force, the Guardian split the <b>Veil of Wonder</b> into six fragments and scattered them across the six islands of the Dreamscape. Now, your mission is to collect each fragment and restore the Veil on the <b>main island</b>. With the Guardian too weak to continue, the journey to save Christmas rests entirely in your hands.
narrative: >
    As you stand at the edge of the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b>, the Guardian of the Veil of Wonder reappears, her form flickering. Her voice is soft but urgent.
    <br><br>
    <i>"Time doesn’t flow the same way on each island. It bends and shifts — some islands will slow you down, others will speed time up. To retrieve the fragments of the Veil, you'll need to carefully calculate your journey."</i> She gestures to the islands, each pulsing with its own strange rhythm. <i>"Misjudge the timing, and you may arrive too late."</i>
    <br><br>
    You study the islands — some shimmer with vibrant energy, others seem slow and distant. The path to the main island is far from simple.
    <br><br>
    <i>"While you make your way through the islands, I will rest,"</i> the Guardian continues. <i>"If your timing is correct, I will meet you at the main island to help restore the Veil. But remember, if you miscalculate, you could lose precious time."</i>
    <br><br>
    She waits, her eyes on you, as the weight of the task settles in. You must calculate the timings perfectly.
objective: >
    Carefully calculate the time it will take to travel through all six islands and meet the Guardian at the main island to restore the Veil of Wonder.
outcome: >
    After presenting your calculations, the Guardian smiles faintly. <i>"Your plan is sound,"</i> she says, <i>"but there's something you didn’t realize. The fragment from this island is <b>already with you</b> — I gave it to you when I brought you here."</i>
    <br><br>
    A soft glow within you confirms it. You’ve already taken the first step.
    <br><br>
    <i>"Now, go to the <b>Main Island</b> to <b>restore the missing bridges</b>. Only then can you reach the other islands and gather the remaining fragments. Time is short."</i>
    <br><br>
    With the first fragment in hand, you prepare to journey to the Main Island and continue your quest.

The **Forgotten Dreamscape** is made up of six islands surrounding the **main island at the center**. To collect the fragments of the Veil of Wonder, you must travel from your **starting island**, pass through the main island, and continue to the six surrounding islands. Time flows differently on each island, and the cloud bridges between islands take no time to travel.

Below are the **estimated times** you will spend on **each island**, along with the **time dilation factor** for each island. Your task is to calculate **how long** it will take to **complete the journey** and meet the Guardian at the main island.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>40 minutes</td>
            <td>x0.25 (time moves very slowly)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>12 minutes</td>
            <td>x1.5 (time moves faster than normal)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Main Island</td>
            <td>
                10 minutes to reactivate bridges, <br>
                10 minutes for displacement between bridges
            </td>
            <td>No time dilation</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Notice that:
- You start at **Island 3**.
- When reaching the **main island** to travel to another island, you must account **10 minutes** for displacement between bridges.
- The answer is the total number of **minutes**.

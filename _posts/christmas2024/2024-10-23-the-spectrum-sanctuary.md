title: "Day 20: The Spectrum Sanctuary"
previously: >
    On the <b>Island of Twisted Toys</b>, you powered up the ancient <b>Mystic Processing Wheel</b>, refining enough Lunar Dust to unlock the hidden compartment containing the next fragment of the Veil of Wonder. With the fourth fragment in hand and the island’s enchantments reawakened, you prepare to journey onward, determined to recover all the pieces needed to restore the Veil’s magic.
narrative: >
    As you set foot on the <b>Spectrum Sanctuary</b>, a calm yet mysterious island bathed in soft, diffused light, you’re immediately struck by the unusual architecture around you. Intricate stonework lines the path forward, guiding you to a small, secluded chamber. Inside, the ceiling is adorned with an enormous, multifaceted glass pane — a prism that catches the sun’s rays, refracting the light into vivid beams that cascade across the room.
    <br><br>
    The walls are illuminated by these seven spectral colors, each casting a distinct, shimmering letter onto the stone surface. The letters appear random at first, scattered along the walls in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet hues. Yet, as you study the arrangement, you sense a hidden message waiting to be deciphered — a message encoded in light itself. Only by uncovering the word projected by the colors can you unlock the fragment concealed within this radiant sanctuary.
objective: >
    Decode the word formed by the letters projected in each color of the spectrum to unlock the next fragment.
outcome: >
    After carefully piecing together the colors of the rainbow and deciphering the word, you whisper it aloud. Instantly, the vibrant beams of light converge into a single, brilliant ray, illuminating a hidden path leading outside the sanctuary. Following the path, you find yourself at a quiet clearing in the <b>forebay</b>, where the next fragment of the Veil of Wonder rests upon an ancient pedestal.
    <br><br>
    As you grasp the fragment, a gentle warmth spreads through you, and you sense the magic of the island growing stronger. With five fragments now secured, the final island await as you move ever closer to restoring the Veil’s magic.

Inside the **Spectrum Sanctuary**, beams of sunlight pass through the prism overhead, casting seven colors across the chamber. Each color illuminates a single letter on the walls:
- **Violet** projects the letter **Y**
- **Red** projects the letter **F**
- **Orange** projects the letter **O**
- **Green** projects the letter **E**
- **Blue** projects the letter **B**
- **Yellow** projects the letter **R**
- **Indigo** projects the letter **A**

The answer is the word formed by the projected letters.

 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Each color projects a different letter, but together, they form a single word. Try reordering them by the natural spectrum of colors.

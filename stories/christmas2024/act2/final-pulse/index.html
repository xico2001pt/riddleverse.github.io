    <h2>Previously</h2>
    After being trapped in separate cells by the malevolent force, you and Jolly managed to escape by working together. Using a malfunctioning digital lock, you deduced the missing piece of the code, freeing Jolly from its cell. <br><br> Now, with the prison behind you, you move deeper into the palace. The <b>Crystal of Joy</b> is within reach, but it remains guarded by the same force that deceived you earlier. With one final challenge ahead, you must confront the last obstacle to restore hope to the Christmas Realm.

    <h2>Narrative</h3>
    You and Jolly make your way through the palace’s final corridor, the light dimming with each step. Ahead, you see it — the <b>Crystal of Joy</b>, suspended in the center of an ornate chamber, but it’s not glowing. Instead, the crystal is surrounded by four shifting barriers, each one pulsing with dark energy: <b>Fear</b>, <b>Doubt</b>, <b>Sorrow</b>, and <b>Despair</b>. The malevolent force has woven these barriers from the very emotions that have drained the crystal’s power, standing as the final obstacle between you and your goal. <br><br> Jolly’s sensors flicker as it analyzes the barriers, its voice tinged with urgency. <i>“These aren’t ordinary defenses. Each of these barriers represents something stronger than physical power. They’re drawn from the energy that’s drained the Crystal.”</i> <br><br> You look at Jolly, waiting for a plan, but even Jolly seems uncertain for a moment. Then it speaks again. <i>“We don’t have the magic to break these barriers. But... we have something else.”</i> <br><br> Jolly opens a small compartment on its side, revealing a powerful <b>Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)</b> generator. <i>“I can disrupt the barriers with EMPs, but I’ll need to carefully control the power I use for each one. If I miscalculate, it’ll overload my systems or drain the battery before we can get through them all.”</i> <br><br> You study the four barriers, each one pulsing with its own rhythm. The solution is within reach, but the path forward requires precise calculations. <i>“I’ll need you to help me figure out how much power to use for each barrier,”</i> Jolly continues. <i>“The total energy can’t exceed my battery’s capacity, and each barrier will need a specific amount to weaken it.”</i> <br><br> There’s no turning back now — the Crystal of Joy is within reach. <i>“We need to get this right! It’s our only chance to restore the crystal.”</i>

    <h2>Objective</h3>
    Help Jolly determine the correct power levels to disrupt the four barriers and shatter the defenses around the Crystal of Joy.

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Jolly has the capability to use <strong>electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)</strong> to shatter the <strong>four barriers</strong> surrounding the <strong>Crystal of Joy</strong>. However, each barrier requires a specific amount of power to be disrupted, and Jolly’s battery has a limited capacity.</p>

<p>The <strong>power</strong> needed for each barrier follows <strong>specific rules</strong> based on the strength of the emotional energy each barrier draws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>sum of the power</strong> required for <strong>all four barriers</strong> equals <strong>100 units</strong> (Jolly’s full battery capacity).</li>
  <li>The barrier of <strong>Doubt</strong> requires <strong>more 5 units</strong> of power than <strong>Fear</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Despair</strong> demands <strong>twice the amount</strong> of power as <strong>Sorrow</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong> and <strong>Sorrow together</strong> use exactly <strong>45 units</strong> of power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your answer must be contain the amount of power dedicated to each barrier — <strong>Fear</strong>, <strong>Doubt</strong>, <strong>Sorrow</strong>, and <strong>Despair</strong>, respectively — separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>). An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">25,20,30,25</code>.</p>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by replacing the barriers' names by letters and formalizing the problem as a system of equations.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Try to replace the variables of the equation so that you end up with only one variable remaining.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 3</summary>
 You can also use trial and error. Or use an online equation solver.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        As you and Jolly execute the calculated power levels, the electromagnetic pulses surge toward the barriers. One by one, the barriers shimmer and collapse, their dark energy dissipating into the air. The Crystal of Joy flickers, its light slowly returning, but something is wrong. The crystal's glow is faint, and the malevolent presence still lingers. <br><br> Jolly scans the area, and a moment of silence follows before it speaks, its voice heavy with realization. <i>“It’s not over. The Guardian is still corrupted by the force. To fully restore the crystal, I need to send one final pulse... a stronger one, but it will drain the last of my energy.”</i> <br><br> You look at Jolly, understanding what this means. <i>“If you do that, you... you won’t make it.”</i> <br><br> Jolly’s mechanical eyes flicker, but there’s no hesitation in its response. <i>“It’s the only way. The Guardian is bound to this corruption, and I’m the only one who can break it. I was built for this — my purpose was always to protect joy.”</i> <br><br> A surge of energy builds within Jolly’s frame as it readies itself for the final pulse. <i>“Goodbye, my friend,”</i> it says, its voice soft but resolute. <i>“You must continue on. The Crystal will restore the carnival, but there’s no time to rest. The last artifact it's in danger. You need to go... now.”</i> <br><br> As Jolly releases the final pulse, a brilliant wave of energy bursts from its body, shattering the remaining darkness around the <b>Crystal of Joy</b>. The corrupted Guardian convulses, then finally, the malevolent force releases its grip. The Crystal glows brighter and brighter until it floods the palace with radiant light. The dark, twisted carnival decorations fade, replaced by the vibrant, joyful atmosphere of a restored Christmas Realm. <br><br> But the light is blinding — too intense. A low rumble shakes the ground beneath your feet. Before you can react, a powerful explosion erupts from the Crystal, sending a shockwave through the chamber. The force throws you backward, slamming into the cold, stone floor. Your vision blurs, the sound of the world fading into a high-pitched ring as darkness overtakes you. <br><br> When you awaken, everything has changed. The carnival is gone...

    <h2>Previously</h2>
    After gathering the healing seeds in the Vault of the Ember, you journeyed to the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b> and restored the Guardian of the Veil of Wonder. With her strength renewed, you feel a powerful resolve settle over you — knowing that the final step to fully restore Christmas magic now awaits.

    <h2>Narrative</h3>
    With the guardians, Jolly, and the three precious artifacts in hand (although one of them not fully restored), you prepare for the <b>ultimate confrontation</b> on the main island of the <b>Forgotten Dreamscape</b>. The journey is tense, each moment echoing with the weight of the mission ahead. When you reach the island, the air feels heavy, charged with the sinister energy of the evil force now fully manifest. Shadows coil and twist like living tendrils, and atop a jagged peak, the <b>final fragment of the Veil of Wonder</b> is held captive within a vortex of dark magic. <br><br> The evil force lets out a menacing laugh, its voice reverberating across the sky. It challenges you and your companions, taunting the strength of the guardians and the light of your artifacts. Jolly steps forward, rallying everyone with a determined gaze. <i>"We have come this far together,"</i> Jolly says. <i>"Now, it’s time to end this darkness once and for all!"</i> <br><br> The guardians stand shoulder to shoulder, each one channeling the power of their artifacts. The Guardian of Warmth holds the blazing <b>Ember of Warmth</b>, casting waves of protective fire. The Guardian of Joy raises the <b>Crystal of Joy</b>, its light dispelling shadow. And the Guardian of Wonder focuses all remaining strength to support her allies with radiant threads of magic. Each artifact unleashes its latent power to generate a series of magical abilities. Fire, light, healing, barriers, illusions, and more, nine distinct powers emerge, each one vital to overcoming the dark force. <br><br> However, the power needed to break the barrier is immense, and <b>every use of magic comes at a cost</b>. Each power carries a specific weight in terms of energy consumption, and the total energy available is limited. You must carefully <b>select which powers to use</b> and how to combine them to maximize their impact against the swirling vortex, while ensuring the guardians retain enough energy to maintain the assault and defend themselves. <br><br> <i>"Choose wisely,"</i> warns the Guardian of Wonder, her gaze resolute but weary. <i>"The fate of our realm rests on finding the perfect balance."</i> With every moment, the vortex's grip tightens, and the evil force’s shadows loom closer. The challenge is clear: harness the nine powers generated by the artifacts, maximize their effectiveness, and defeat the dark force while staying within the constraints of the combined magical energy available. Only then can you reclaim the final fragment and restore the Veil of Wonder.

    <h2>Objective</h3>
    Strategically select which of the nine magical powers generated by the artifacts will maximize the impact within the available energy constraints, breaking the barrier protecting the final fragment, and defeating the evil force.

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>As the battle against the evil force reaches its climax, you must harness the artifacts’ nine magical powers to overcome the protective barrier around the final fragment. However, your ability to channel these powers is limited by a <strong>maximum energy capacity of 20 units</strong>. Each power carries a unique energy consumption and contributes a different level of magical power. Your challenge is to <strong>maximize the total power</strong> used within this energy constraint to ensure victory.</p>

<p>The available powers, their energy weights, and their strengths are as follows:
|Id|Name|Energy Consumption|Magical Power|
|—|—|—|—|
|1|Radiant Blaze|2|12|
|2|Gale’s Whisper|3|10|
|3|Titan’s Embrace|5|20|
|4|Lunar Shield|6|15|
|5|Starlight Surge|7|25|
|6|Ember’s Touch|4|8|
|7|Crystal Bloom|3|9|
|8|Ethereal Echo|8|30|
|9|Void’s Wrath|9|50|</p>

<p>Notice that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your goal is to <strong>maximize the total magical power</strong> without exceeding the <strong>energy capacity of 20 units</strong>.</li>
  <li>The answer must contain the <strong>ids of the used powers</strong>, in any order, separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>). An example of a possible answer (obviously wrong) could be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8,1,5,7</code>.</li>
</ul>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Focus on selecting the combination of powers that provides the highest total magical force while staying within the 20-unit energy limit. Sometimes, choosing fewer powerful abilities can be more effective than many weaker ones.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 This problem is know as the knapsack problem. There are solvers online.

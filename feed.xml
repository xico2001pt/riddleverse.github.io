<p>Each time you submit a digit by aligning the shadow with it, the rapid movement of the sun causes the shadow to shift <strong>30 degrees clockwise</strong>. Calculate the minimum total degrees of rotation required to align the shadow with the entire passcode sequence in the correct order.</p>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Remember, each time you submit a digit, the sun’s position causes the shadow to move 30 degrees clockwise. This will affect the next alignment you need to make.

 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 To minimize the total rotation, consider rotating the dial in the shortest direction to reach each target number.

The image has been divided into a <strong>4x4 grid</strong>, with each slice out of order.</p>

<p>Each slice corresponds to a numbered filename (e.g., 01.png, 02.png, etc.). Arrange the slices in the correct order to restore the complete image of the fragment’s location.</p>

  <li>Place them <strong>from left to right</strong> in each row, moving <strong>top to bottom</strong>.</li>
  <li>Your final answer should be the sequence of filenames from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>16</strong> in their correct positions.</li>
  <li>The answer should be an ordered sequence of the images’ names separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>). Exclude any leading zeros from the answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the answer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16</code> will correspond to the tiles ordered in the following way:</p>

<p>You wake up from the explosion. As your vision clears, you realize you are no longer in the crumbling palace but in a strange, ethereal world. The air here feels different — heavy with mystery and magic. Beside you stands a ghostly figure, the <strong>Guardian of the Veil of Wonder</strong>, her form shimmering like stardust in the soft light.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>“I used the last of my strength to bring you here,”</em> she says, her voice gentle but fading. <em>“Before the explosion, I anticipated the coming of the evil force. To protect the Veil, I split it into six fragments and scattered them across the islands of the <strong>Forgotten Dreamscape</strong>. This is where the last hope for restoring Christmas lies.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The Guardian gestures toward the horizon, where the islands float in the mist. <em>“The <strong>main island</strong>, where the Veil must be restored, is at the center of this realm. However, two of the islands have been severed from it, cut off by the malevolent force. To reassemble the Veil of Wonder, you must <strong>visit all six islands</strong>, reclaim the fragments, and return them to the main island to reignite its power.”</em>
<br /></p>

<p>Her voice softens, growing faint as her form flickers. <em>“I am too weak now to guide you further. You must continue alone. But be careful — this realm is fragile, and the evil force grows stronger with each passing moment.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The journey ahead is daunting, but the path is clear.

However, each barrier requires a specific amount of power to be disrupted, and Jolly’s battery has a limited capacity.</p>

<p>The <strong>power</strong> needed for each barrier follows <strong>specific rules</strong> based on the strength of the emotional energy each barrier draws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>sum of the power</strong> required for <strong>all four barriers</strong> equals <strong>100 units</strong> (Jolly’s full battery capacity).</li>
  <li>The barrier of <strong>Doubt</strong> requires <strong>more 5 units</strong> of power than <strong>Fear</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Despair</strong> demands <strong>twice the amount</strong> of power as <strong>Sorrow</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong> and <strong>Sorrow together</strong> use exactly <strong>45 units</strong> of power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your answer must be contain the amount of power dedicated to each barrier — <strong>Fear</strong>, <strong>Doubt</strong>, <strong>Sorrow</strong>, and <strong>Despair</strong>, respectively — separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>).

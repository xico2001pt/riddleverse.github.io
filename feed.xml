<p>As you step through the portal, the icy winds of the Frostspire are left behind, replaced by something far more unsettling. The air is thick, heavy with a sense of unease, and the sky above is a patchwork of dark clouds and garish lights. Before you stretches the once-vibrant <strong>Realm of Joy</strong>, now twisted into a grotesque reflection of its former self. Where there was once laughter and music, now eerie echoes and distorted melodies hang in the air. The festival grounds, a place that once symbolized happiness and lightheartedness, have become a dark carnival, its joy drained by the malevolent force.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The <strong>Crystal of Joy</strong>, once glowing with radiant colors, has darkened and now casts a dim, sickly light over the land. It is hidden deep within the heart of the festival, locked away in the <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>, where the <strong>Guardian of Laughter</strong> — the one sworn to protect it — has been corrupted. The Guardian’s once carefree and playful nature has been twisted into mockery, their laughter now cruel and haunting.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As you survey the warped carnival before you, you feel the weight of the task ahead. The vibrant tents and rides are now eerie silhouettes, looming in the distance. The flickering lights, once warm and inviting, now pulse with unnatural energy. The path is obscured by <strong>illusions</strong> and riddled with <strong>emotional traps</strong> meant to confuse and demoralize you.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But you cannot falter. To restore the Crystal of Joy, you will need to make your way through the heart of the festival, break through the illusions, and face the twisted Guardian. Only then can you hope to return joy and laughter to the Christmas Realm.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>With determination, you take your first step into the twisted carnival. The journey to restore joy has begun…</p>]]></content><author><name>Francisco Cerqueira</name></author><category term="christmas2024" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 6: Shattering the Veil</title><link href="https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act1/shattering-the-veil/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 6: Shattering the Veil" /><published>2024-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act1/shattering-the-veil</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://riddleverse.franciscogc.com/stories/christmas2024/act1/shattering-the-veil/"><![CDATA[<p>A malevolent force has enveloped the mystical Ember with four elemental barriers.

Each recipe requires specific quantities of ingredients, and you must calculate the total amount needed for each ingredient to produce <strong>exactly one</strong> Essence of Warmth.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ingredients:
- Fire Herb (F)
- Sunstone Dust (S)
- Ember Flower (E)
- Ash Root (A)
- Glowing Coal (G)

Recipes:
- 3 Fire Herb (F) + 2 Sunstone Dust (S) + 1 Ash Root (A) = 2 Warm Essence (W)
- 4 Ember Flower (E) + 1 Ash Root (A) = 3 Flame Potion (P)

<p>Given this information, your task is to determine how many of each base ingredient is required to make the final product.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your answer must be in the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FxSxExAxGx</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> represents the amount of the ingredient preceding it.

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 Start by figuring out how many Warm Essences (W) and Blazing Cores (B) are needed for the final Essence of Warmth.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Break down Recipe 3 carefully — it involves three ingredients, and you’ll need to make sure you produce enough Flame Potions and Sunstone Dust to create the Blazing Core.

The top-left corner contains the sunlight source focused through a magnifying glass, and the bottom-right corner is blocked by snow and ice, preventing your exit.</p>

<p>Due to your weakened state, you can only rotate two solar panels. Your task is to position them so that the sunlight reflects from panel to panel and reaches the snow-covered path at the bottom-right corner, melting the snow and clearing the way.</p>

<p>Here a representation of your location:</p>

<div><img class="challenge-img" src="/assets/img/stories/christmas2024/gridfield-with-panels.webp" /></div>

<p>Keep these aspects in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rotate <strong>exactly two</strong> solar panels to direct the sunlight from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.</li>
  <li>The beam of light is casted with a <strong>45-degree</strong> angle, i.e. diagonally (as depicted by the arrow).</li>
  <li>The solar panels can only be rotated by a <strong>90-degree</strong> angle. Therefore, their orientation is either <strong>horizontal</strong> or <strong>vertical</strong>.</li>
  <li>The answer must contain the <strong>coordinates</strong> of the solar panels that need to be <strong>rotated</strong>.</li>
  <li>The answer must folow the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x,y x,y</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> indicates the column index and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> indicates the row index. The top left corner position is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1,1</code>, while the bottom right position is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8,8</code>. The order of the positions is irrelevant.</li>
</ul>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary> 
 The light moves in straight lines and bounces at 90-degree angles from the panels. Consider which panels would redirect the ligth to a valid position.
</details>
<details>
 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 Try starting from the end position and backtracking the beam path. There aren't so many options available...

Some glow brightly, while others appear cracked and unstable, as if someone has tried and failed to ascend before. You notice that the steps marked <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>7</strong>, and <strong>11</strong> appear safe, while others (up to the step number 11) show signs of wear and danger.</p>

<p>The Guardian’s cryptic words echo in your mind:</p>

  <p>Step only on those numbers that follow the rhythm of the prime.</p>

<p>Given the fact that the staircase has 30 steps and the steps are inscribed with numbers ranging from 1 to 30, your task is to determine the correct sequence of safe steps based on this pattern.</p>

<p>Notice that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sequence values should be separated by commas (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>).</li>
  <li>The sequence should start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2,3,5,7,11</code> and must be ordered from the smallest to the largest value.</li>

<p>Here is the maze that you drew:</p>

<p>Notice the following assumptions:</p>

<details>
 <summary>Hint 1</summary>
 The simplest (yet most time-consuming) approach is to determine the path <b>dynamically</b>, by rotating the maze each time you make a move. But there is a clever way to solve it...

 <summary>Hint 2</summary>
 The second approach consists in determining the path <b>statically</b>, by solving the path while ignoring the rotations. After that, you only need to rotate each step according to its position in the sequence. For example, the second step should be rotated by 90 degrees, the third by 180 degrees, and so on.

<p>In a hidden realm parallel to our world, the Christmas Spirit is kept alive by three powerful artifacts: the Ember of Warmth, the Crystal of Joy, and the Veil of Wonder. Each artifact rests under the protection of legendary Guardians. Every century, these artifacts must be reawakened to renew the magic of Christmas. But this year, something has gone terribly wrong.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>A malevolent force has swept through the Christmas Realm, imprisoning the Guardians and securing the artifacts. Without the artifacts, the magic of Christmas will fade, and with it, the warmth, joy, and wonder cherished by people across the world.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Your quest begins at the coldest point of this calamity—the Ember of Warmth. Once the heart of the Christmas Realm’s light and love, it now lies dormant, hidden deep within the Vault of the Hearth. The Guardian of the Hearth, bound in icy chains, can no longer protect it. The once vibrant lands are now veiled in a creeping chill, and the Ember’s glow has dimmed, casting shadows where warmth used to reign.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To restore balance and save Christmas, you must embark on a perilous journey into the frozen wilderness. The Ember of Warmth must be reignited, but the path is treacherous, filled with ancient puzzles and guarded secrets. The fate of the Christmas Realm, and the very spirit of Christmas, rests in your hands.</p>

<p><br /></p>
